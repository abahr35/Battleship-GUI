# Battleship Re-creation

A classic **Battleship** game implemented in Java with a graphical user interface using **Java Swing**. This project models the complete game of Battleship with full functionality and adheres to object-oriented programming principles including inheritance, polymorphism, and generics.

## ðŸ•¹ Features

- **GUI built with Java Swing**  
  A fully interactive interface that displays the game board with coordinate-based grid layout for intuitive play.

- **Game Mechanics**  
  - Turn-based gameplay with hit/miss feedback  
  - Ship placement and validation  
  - Win condition detection  

- **Object-Oriented Design**  
  - Proper use of **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **generics**  
  - Modular and maintainable code structure

- **Ability to Create more AI difficulties with inheritance**
